# 🚀 Omnix AI Copilot  
**Your Personal AI Chat Assistant — Built with Spring Boot, JSP, and Gemini API**

---

## 🧠 Overview

**Omnix AI Copilot** is a smart, dynamic AI chat system designed to make conversations natural, organized, and efficient.  
It’s built using **Spring Boot (Java)**, **JSP frontend**, and **Gemini API** integration, featuring **session-based chat management**, **auto-session renaming**, and a **clean, modern interface**.

I started this project when I was struggling to find job opportunities.  
Coming from a **B.Com background**, I refused to give up — I learned coding, built this AI from scratch using my own logic and effort.  
Omnix represents not just a project — it’s my **proof of persistence**, creativity, and self-learning.

## 💡 Inspiration

> “When doors don’t open, build your own.”  

Omnix was born out of my determination to create something real and powerful while learning full-stack development.  
It reflects how AI can help people work smarter — and how consistency can turn struggle into innovation.

## 🪄 How It Works

1. **Start a New Chat Session** → Each session gets a unique ID and title.  
2. **Send a Message** → User input is sent to the backend through `/api/copilot/chat`.  
3. **AI Response** → The Gemini API processes and returns an intelligent reply.  
4. **Auto Rename** → Session title automatically updates based on conversation context.  
5. **History View** → Users can view past chats anytime.
